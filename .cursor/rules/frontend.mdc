# Rules

- Use shadcn components as the default, if not possible make them by scratch with tailwindcss: `https://ui.shadcn.com/`
- Style first with shadcn way of styling and if not enough, make the overrides with tailwindcss
- Make sure to use "Lucide React" `lucide-react` as the default icon library.
- Use server components over client components (unless reactivity is necessary)
- Fetch data within server components and pass the data as props to the client component
  that needs it (unless not viable)
- React components' argument should be called `props` and the type defined as `type Props = {}` must be located above the component.
